Using Bash, I have a string:

string = "My string"
How can I test if it contains another string?

if [ $string ?? 'foo' ]; then
  echo "It's there!"
fi
Where ?? is my unknown operator. Do I use echo and grep?

if echo "$string" | grep 'foo'; then
  echo "It's there!"
fi
That looks a bit clumsy.

As there is already a lot of answers using Bash-specific features, there is a way working under poorer-featured shells, like busybox:

[ -z "${string##*$reqsubstr*}" ]
In practice, this could give:

string='echo "My string"'
for reqsubstr in 'o "M' 'alt' 'str';do
  if [ -z "${string##*$reqsubstr*}" ] ;then
      echo "String '$string' contain substring: '$reqsubstr'."
    else
      echo "String '$string' don't contain substring: '$reqsubstr'."
    fi
  done
