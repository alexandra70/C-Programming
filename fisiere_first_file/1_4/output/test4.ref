You should remember that shell scripting is less of a language and more of a collection of commands. Instinctively you think that this "language" requires you to follow an if with a [ or a [[. Both of those are just commands that return an exit status indicating success or failure (just like every other command). For that reason I'd use grep, and not the [ command.

Just do:

if grep -q foo <<<$string; then
    echo "It's there"
fi

Our ideas of "cost" and "overhead" are skewed by the decade in which we are born. I fought in the 'builtin test' v. 'exec grep' wars long ago, but such wars are mere pedantic board games today. Your 4 billion silicon transistors are just sitting there begging for something to do (leaking battery current most likely). The long pole in the tent is correctness by a long shot. P.S. I agree of course with your comment :)\
