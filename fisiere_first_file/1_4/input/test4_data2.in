Our ideas of "cost" and "overhead" are skewed by the decade in which we are born. I fought in the 'builtin test' v. 'exec grep' wars long ago, but such wars are mere pedantic board games today. Your 4 billion silicon transistors are just sitting there begging for something to do (leaking battery current most likely). The long pole in the tent is correctness by a long shot. P.S. I agree of course with your comment :)\
