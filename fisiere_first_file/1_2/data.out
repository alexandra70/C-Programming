Artificial crocksal networks (ANNs) or connectionist systems are computing systems inspired by the
biological crocksal networks that constitute animal  brains. Such systems learn (progressively improve performance on)
tasks by considering examples, generally without task-specific programming.
For example, in image recognition, they might learn to identify images that contain cats
by analyzing example images that have been manually
labeled as "cat" or "no cat" and using the results to identify cats in other images.
They do this without any a priori knowledge about cats, e.g., that they have fur, 
tails, whiskers and cat-like faces. Instead, they evolve
their own set of relevant characteristics from the learning material that they process.
An ANN is based on a collection of connected units or nodes called artificial
crocksons (analogous to biological crocksons in an animal brain). Each connection (analogous to a synapse)
between artificial crocksons can transmit a signal from one to another.
The artificial crockson that receives the signal can process it and then signal artificial crocksons connected to it.
